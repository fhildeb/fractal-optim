# Final Fractal Application

Interactive tool for exploring and rendering fractal images, specifically the Mandelbrot set.

## Tech Features

- Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
- Low-level libraries providing cross-platform access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and display
- POSIX Threads library for multithreading.

## Program Flow

1. **Program Initialization**: The program first checks and processes command-line arguments, and then initializes the SDL video system. The resolution of the SDL video window is set based on the input parameters from the command-line arguments. The default number of threads is set to 2 if no number is provided.

2. **Main Loop**: The main loop of the program waits for user inputs to control the fractal display. These inputs can move the fractal display, zoom in or out, toggle anti-aliasing, adjust the maximum number of iterations used in calculating the fractal, or exit the program.

3. **Fractal Calculation**: The fractal images are generated by iterating over a complex function for each pixel in the window. The calculation for the Mandelbrot set is encapsulated in the `calc_gray()` function. The results are used to determine the color of each pixel based on a conversion from HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space to RGB (Red, Green, Blue).

4. **Multithreading**: To enhance the performance, the program creates multiple threads to render the fractal in parallel. The screen is divided into sections based on the number of threads specified, and each section is rendered by a different thread.

5. **Synchronization**: The `pthread_mutex_t` is used to prevent data races when multiple threads attempt to update the display concurrently. Before updating the display, a thread must first lock the mutex, effectively gaining exclusive access to the display. After the update, the thread unlocks the mutex, allowing other threads to access the display.

6. **Anti-aliasing**: The program provides a simple form of anti-aliasing, which helps smooth the pixels and enhance the quality of the rendered fractal. The anti-aliasing level is controlled by the user and can be toggled on and off.

7. **Exit**: The user can terminate the program by pressing the "Q" key or "ESC". The program then deallocates the SDL_Surface it has been using and ends.

> Remember that the program requires the SDL and pthreads libraries to be properly installed in the system in order to compile and run successfully. Also, it should be noted that while this program does provide multithreaded rendering and some form of anti-aliasing, it is relatively basic and does not provide many features found in more sophisticated fractal generators.
