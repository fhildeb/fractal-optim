## Description

The application is able to draw 2D fractals based on the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) math calculation and enables to search and move within the visualization to explore the world of mathamatically generated pictures.

## Functionality

- Generate 2D fractal map
- Move around the map
- Zoom in and out
- Anti-Aliasing Sharpness Option
- Increase Fractal Iterations
- Modularly Adaptable Thread Optimization
- Modularly Adaptable Screen Resolution

## Fractal Description

The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points that are generated by a particular function and can be plotted on a graph. It is named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who is credited with popularizing the concept of fractals.

Fractals are geometric shapes or patterns that are self-similar, meaning that they are made up of smaller copies of themselves. They are characterized by their intricate, repeating patterns, which are created by repeating a simple process over and over again.

The Mandelbrot set is a particular type of fractal that is generated by a function that takes a complex number as input and performs a series of mathematical operations on it. The function iteratively calculates the value of the complex number using a formula that involves adding the number back to itself and squaring the result. If the resulting value stays within a certain range, the original complex number is considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set.

Fractals are found in many natural phenomena, such as trees, rivers, and coastlines, and they have been used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science. The Mandelbrot set, in particular, has become well-known for its intricate and beautiful patterns and has been the subject of much research and study.
